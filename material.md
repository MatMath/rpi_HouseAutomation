## Raspberry pi 3:
- Ubuntu 16.04
- Fan for Cooling/HeatSinks
- Breadboard
- Cable for IO pin.

## Blind:
- Motors with geared for lower turn speed/more torque.
- 5V-12V external source to power the motor.
- 2x Transistor to activate the motors.
Flow: The Pi activate 1 pin that activate the transistor and this Give the +5 or -5V to the motor so it open or Close.

## Entrance Light:
On movement detection event activate 1 pin that activate a SSR (Solid State Relay) so it power the 120V or 12V light of the entrance.
Start the USB camera capture. Start a Timer so it stop after X sec.
- 1 SSR (Solid State Relay) of at least 2A (depending of the lighting)
- Movement detector.
- Entrance Camera
